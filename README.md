This project uses embroidered circuits to run a pressure sensor with a fabric actuator. 

The silicone-coated bodice is the base for the circuits and is a wearable device that lights up when contact is made.

The code is fairly simple, and uses the Lilypad library. All the LEDs are sewed in parallel, and the circuit uses two batteries: 
one for the lights and one for the actuator.
